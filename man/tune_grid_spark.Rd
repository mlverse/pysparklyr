\usage{
tune_grid_spark(
  sc,
  object,
  preprocessor,
  resamples,
  ...,
  param_info = NULL,
  grid = 10,
  metrics = NULL,
  eval_time = NULL,
  control = tune::control_grid(),
  no_tasks = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sc}{A Spark Connection}

\item{object}{A parsnip model specification or an unfitted \code{workflow()}. No
tuning parameters are allowed; if arguments have been marked with \code{tune()},
their values must be finalized.}

\item{preprocessor}{A traditional model formula or a recipe created using
\verb{recipes::recipe().}}

\item{resamples}{An rset resampling object created from an rsample function,
such as \code{rsample::vfold_cv()}.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{param_info}{A \code{dials::parameters()} object or NULL. If none is given,
a parameters set is derived from other arguments. Passing this argument can
be useful when parameter ranges need to be customized.}

\item{grid}{A data frame of tuning combinations or a positive integer. The
data frame should have columns for each parameter being tuned and rows for
tuning parameter candidates. An integer denotes the number of candidate
parameter sets to be created automatically.}

\item{metrics}{A \code{yardstick::metric_set()}, or NULL to compute a standard
set of metrics.}

\item{eval_time}{A numeric vector of time points where dynamic event time
metrics should be computed (e.g. the time-dependent ROC curve, etc). The
values must be non-negative and should probably be no greater than the
largest event time in the training set (See Details below).}

\item{control}{An object used to modify the tuning process, likely created
by \code{control_grid()}.}

\item{no_tasks}{Number of parallel tasks (jobs) to request Spark}
